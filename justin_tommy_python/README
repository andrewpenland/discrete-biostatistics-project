To run tests: python3 binstringstest.py
DEPTH is a constant that dictates how deep the unit tests will go. 
I have it set to 4 by default, but a value of 5 runs on my PC in a few minutes. 
Values higher than that run into problems with system resource drain. 
For the functions where the uniformity is set as 3, higher DEPTH values are 
more feasable. Higher r values drain memory.
